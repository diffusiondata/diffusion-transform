        <p>This API builds on top of the <em>Diffusion Java API</em> to enhance the new typed steams and updaters with
            additional data conversion functionality. Such functionality is very opinionated in Java and it was decided
            not suitable for the core library.</p>
        <p>This API currently supports streams and updaters, allowing them to use types not supported by
            <em>Diffusion</em>. This is done by creating a transformer that knows how to convert objects between
            types.</p>
        <p>You can create a stream that converts the data it receives. First get a <em>StreamBuilder</em> and apply
            one or more transformers. Each transformer returns a new <em>StreamBuilder</em> with a different type.
            Once all the transformers have been chained you can call create to register a new stream. Transformed values
            are delivered to the stream you register. You construct a chain of transformers that transform from a
            type <em>Diffusion</em> understands to a custom type.</p>
        <p>You can create an updater that converts the data it sends. First get an <em>UpdaterBuilder</em> and apply
            one or more transformers. Each transformer returns a new <em>UpdaterBuilder</em> with a different type.
            Once all the transformers have been chained you can call create to create a new updater. Values passed to
            the updater will be transformed before sending. You construct a chain of transformers that transform from a
            custom type to a type <em>Diffusion</em> understands.</p>
